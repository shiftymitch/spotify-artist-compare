### Description

I built this Spotify Search API tool to get 2 separate artists at the same time to compare details and statistics. This tool is specifically useful when building music festival lineups, but is also a great way to find artist information without needing a Spotify account or using Spotify's main applications.

---

### How to Use

Open the application in your browser and search for an artist. Click the "Compare" button in the top right corner to load a side by side search feature.
